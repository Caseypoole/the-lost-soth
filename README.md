🛸 **The Lost Secrets of the Holocron**  
A static fan-built archive and registry for the *Secrets of the Holocron* limited edition collector boxset from *Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge*. Only 3,000 of these boxsets exist across the galaxy — this site aims to discover, catalog, and showcase them all.

🌌 **About the Project**  
*The Lost Secrets of the Holocron* is a passion project for collectors and fans of Star Wars lore. It's built as a static website hosted on GitHub Pages that allows users to submit images and info about their unique boxsets. Submissions are reviewed and then published to the public-facing gallery.

Whether you’re safeguarding a blue kyber crystal or illuminating your shelf with Sith red — your Holocron has a story, and this is where it's told.
